## Description:

This repository contains the code to replicate and visualize the results from the simulation studies reported in *The Mixed-Sparse-Smooth-Model Toolbox (MSSM): Efficient Estimation and Selection of Large Multi-Level Statistical Models* by Krause, Borst, & van Rij. A preprint is available [on arXiv](). The results in the preprint were generated under [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/index.html) version 1.9-3 and [MSSM](https://github.com/JoKra1/mssm) version 1.0.1. Additionally, [mssmViz](https://github.com/JoKra1/mssm_tutorials) is required to generate the simulated datasets and to create the plots.

## Running the Simulations:

 - Clone the repository
 - Install ``mssm``, ``mssmViz``, and ``mgcv``
 - Run the ``sim_*.ipynb`` notebooks
 - Run the ``sim_.Rmd`` notebooks
 - Run ``sim_viz.ipynb`` notebook for plots and summaries
